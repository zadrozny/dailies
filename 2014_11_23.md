Debugging scraper: problems with regular expressions. 

How to match any string that does not contain a substring?

For example, given: 
	'http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/world/middleeast'
	'http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/world/middleeast'
	'http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/world/middleeast'

How to match any such string that does not contain '2014' (or 'middleast')?
